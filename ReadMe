Task 2: SVM Kernel Comparison & 2D Decision Boundary Visualization
📋 Project Overview
This project is part of the Level 3 Machine Learning Internship tasks. It explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify customer churn, specifically comparing how different mathematical kernels handle complex data boundaries.

📊 Key Objectives
Kernel Comparison: Directly evaluate and compare the performance of Linear and RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernels.

Dimensionality Reduction: Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project high-dimensional behavioral data into 2D for visual analysis.

Decision Boundary Visualization: Generate a visual contour map to show how the SVM separates "Churn" from "No Churn" zones.

Comprehensive Evaluation: Measure model success using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
1. Data Preparation
Source: The model uses the Customer Churn dataset, split into training (churn-bigml-80.csv) and testing (churn-bigml-20.csv) sets.

Encoding: Categorical features like 'International plan' and 'Voice mail plan' are converted into binary numerical format.

Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to all 17 behavioral features. Note: This is a critical step for SVMs because they are distance-based algorithms.

2. SVM Kernel Analysis
I compared two distinct SVM approaches:

Linear Kernel: Best suited for datasets where classes can be separated by a straight line.

RBF Kernel: A non-linear approach that can capture more complex patterns in customer behavior.

3. PCA Visualization
Because the dataset has 17 features, it is impossible to visualize directly. I used PCA to reduce the data to its two most significant components. This allowed for the generation of a 2D plot showing the model's decision regions.

📈 Results Summary
The script outputs a final comparison table and a confusion matrix to validate the findings.

RBF Kernel: Generally performs better on this dataset as customer churn patterns are rarely strictly linear.

Visual Insight: The PCA plot clearly illustrates the "islands" of churn behavior within the overall customer base.

💻 How to Run
Requirement: Ensure scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib are installed.


Execution: Run the script to see the performance metrics and generated plots.
