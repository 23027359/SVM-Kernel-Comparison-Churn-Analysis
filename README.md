# SVM-Kernel-Comparison-Churn-Analysis
A comparative study of Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels (Linear vs. RBF) for predicting customer churn. This project utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for 2D decision boundary visualization and evaluates model performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC and Confusion Matrices.
